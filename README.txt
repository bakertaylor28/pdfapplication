PDF Application is a php CMS which relies on fpdf, and which allows a server administrator to deploy the presentation of a contract, 
allows the user to sign the contract, outputs the contract to a PDF file, and then allows both the user and the administrator 
access to the output pdf file.  

The login information for the user site, located at https://pdfapplication.000webhostapp.com
is:

username is either test or administrator, 
and password is password.

Both the test and administrator accounts allow signing of documents, but the test account (which is a regular user account) only allows
viewing files generated by that account in the view-docs tab (/database-view.php). The administrator account allows viewing documents
submitted by all user acocunts including administrator account. 

Installation of this package should be straight forward for those whom are experienced in dealing with a LAMP server,
so detail will not be given here. Refer to fpdf's documentation to learn how to use fpdf. This package requires a
fair bit of understanding php in order to use it effectively. It is not for the novice.
The main files that you will want to change for your purposes with respect to content are:
/scripts/connect.php
/inc/ipsum.txt 
/sign.php
/pdfexample.php

The scripts folder contains connect.php in which the SQL database connection informaton should be set.
SQL.txt contains the names and structure of the SQL tables necessary to run the applicaton. 

The inc folder contains ipsum.txt, which is used to place the contract to be signed in an iframe in sign.php. 
Sign.php passes the user's signature as a post variable to the php script /pdfexample.php which builds the PDF file
using the FPDF library.
